### About the project
In this project, I aimed to demonstrate my ability to apply the technologies I have been studying and improving, with the goal of using them in future projects. The focus was on developing a clean, adaptive, concise, and efficient interface. Additionally, I implemented a language selection feature using JSON, a technology I am currently exploring. This allows users to choose their preferred language for viewing the page, providing a more personalized and accessible experience.
